## Learning Goals:
At the time of this project, I am a student at Turing School of Software Engineering in the front end development program, in mod 3. The goal of this project was to practice programming in React, using React router v6, and to explore functionality with React such as being able to favorite and search through elements. I refactored my original project in React to use React with TypeScript.
